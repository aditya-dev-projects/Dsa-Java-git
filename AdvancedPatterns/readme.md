# 🔷 Advanced Patterns in Java – Pattern Practice 🚀

This folder contains solutions to commonly asked **pattern problems** in Java using nested loops.

Each pattern is saved in a separate file (`pattern1.java` to `pattern5.java`) along with its compiled `.class` file.

## 🧠 General Logic

To build logic for these problems, we use the **matrix method** (rows × columns):

- Outer loop → controls how many **lines** to print (`rows`)
- Inner loop → controls **what to print** in each line (`columns`)
- Conditions like `i == 1`, `j == n`, `i + j == n + 1` help define pattern logic
